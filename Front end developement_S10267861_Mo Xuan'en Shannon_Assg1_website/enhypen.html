  ENHYPEN is a South Korean boy band formed by BELIFT LAB.  The group consists of seven multinational members JUNGWON, HEESEUNG, JAY, JAKE, SUNGHOON, SUNOO, and NI-KI.  They were the finalists of a global music competition show ‘I-LAND.’
The group officially debuted on November 30th, 2020 with the song “Given-Taken”.  ENHYPEN are known for their dynamic and highly synchronized performances, which garnered them international praise as the “4th Generation Hot Icons” and “Global K-pop Rising Stars.”  They are the fastest K-pop boy group to become a million seller, and the first and only K-pop act in history to have all of their albums RIAJ certified.
Their fandom name is ENGENE, which is derived from the words “engine” and “gene.”  ENGENES are the engines that help them “keep going” and the genes that share the same DNA as the group to “connect, discover, and grow together.”
